# Stream-cypher Thing

I had an idea that probably exists already and have applied it probably poorly. But it's good experience and, I think, an interesting idea.

Stream cypher in a 5:4 compression ratio

#### TODO

- Build blocks of 5 into bitmap entry and four bringing it to 1+x:1 ratio
- Make pretty the code
